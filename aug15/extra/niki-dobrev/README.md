Gmail was complaining about some file type issue, that prevents sending my .zip-file (https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6590). I guess it was because of the path inside the zip file which contains "github.com" (as .com seems to be forbidden). So for that reason, here is a new .zip with "src/github.com" renamed to "src/githubcom". 

IMPORTANT:
Please rename the path back to src/github.com after unzipping to get the tests working correctly. 

Some feedback on the challenge:

Getting started was the biggest pain point. The requirements were a bit
vague: at least for me with practically zero prior knowledge of go
language and ecosystem. I think it would be easier to get more people
along, if you had more exact requirements (it seems, that previous
challenges had more exact requirements).

Once I figured out what to do (read the conversations on slack-channel,
which was a huge help!), I found the challenge interesting and a really
good way to get to know the language. For me personally, especially
dealing with the language itself (identifiers, AST etc.) was an
interesting way to learn the language.
