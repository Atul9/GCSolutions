Category: Participating and exploring further (does it mean that I will support the tool in future if it needs that?)

The main package is in github.com/dooman87/gounexport/cmd folder (just was looking for other tools).

Also, I left my thoughts for you in README.md. I'm looking forward to write a blog post about this cool experience.

Thanks a lot for interesting task and hope to hear from you soon.
