My implementation does the following:

* Implements a standard 3d pipline with a model/view/projection matrix
* Implements per pixel lighting that changes based of what key you press
* Allows for multiple keys to be pressed
* Generates the wav forms for the notes dynamically
* Includes an arcball for rotating the keyboard. If you tap off of the piano and drag around you can rotate the piano. Tapping the keys still works even once you've rotated it.
