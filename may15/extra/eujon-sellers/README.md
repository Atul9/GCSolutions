Here are some sample mosaics created by the app:

And the instructions to run are:

- build with `go build`
- run (probably via sudo/as root since it binds to port 80): "./mosaic"
- if you're running locally just go to http://localhost/  from there you can pick what image you want to create a mosaic out of as well as any search terms.

The other alternative is to just go to:

[http://mosaic.esheavyindustries.com](http://mosaic.esheavyindustries.com) and use it there.
