Some sample output mosaics are available under the `static/images` directory of the included archive. They are images of actors from popular films, and are composed of images drawn from the flickr api using the search terms kitten, corvette, and mountain.

My submission is in the form of a web application. Upon running locally, you can navigate to localhost:555, where you will find a form allowing you to enter 1-3 search terms and select a source image.

While you may run and test this application locally, you may also access it online at [http://gdfgdfgdf.com:555/](http://gdfgdfgdf.com:555/).
