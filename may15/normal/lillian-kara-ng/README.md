# Go Photo Mosaic

Thanks for taking my submission for the Golang challenge 3. I started building this submission with some of the older requirements, so it doesn't work for a directory of images yet. Instead it lets you get images from instagram by using the hashtag search endpoint. I didn't include an Instagram client id in this submission, but if the 
reviewers need to run it, I can send you a client id by email. Alternatively, any Instagram client Id can be used.

Given a URL for the source image, and a hashtag, it builds a photo mosaic from recent Instagram hashtag images. You need an Instagram client id to build a mosaic.
